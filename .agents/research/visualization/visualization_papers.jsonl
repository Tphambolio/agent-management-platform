{"title": "Real-Time Cloth Simulation Using WebGPU: Evaluating Limits of   High-Resolution", "abstract": "This study explores the capabilities of WebGPU, an emerging web graphics paradigm, for real-time cloth simulation. Traditional WebGL-based methods have been in handling complex physical simulations due to their emphasis on graphics rendering rather than general-purpose GPU (GPGPU) operations. WebGPU, designed to provide modern 3D graphics and computational capabilities, offers significant improvements through parallel processing and support for computational shaders. In this work, we implemented a cloth simulation system using the Mass-Spring Method within the WebGPU framework, integrating collision detection and response handling with the 3D surface model. First, comparative performance evaluations demonstrate that WebGPU substantially outperforms WebGL, particularly in high-resolution simulations, maintaining 60 frames per second (fps) even with up to 640K nodes. The second experiment aimed to determine the real-time limitations of WebGPU and confirmed that WebGPU can handle real-time collisions between 4K and 100k cloth node models and a 100K triangle surface model in real-time. These experiments also highlight the importance of balancing real-time performance with realistic rendering when handling collisions between cloth models and complex 3D objects.

Exploiting WebGL for attacks will affect billions of users since browsers serve as the main interaction mechanism with the world wide web. This paper explores the potential threats derived from the recent move by browsers from WebGL 1.0 to the more powerful WebGL 2.0. We focus on two possible abuses of this feature: distributed password cracking and distributed cryptocurrency mining. Our evaluation of the attacks also includes the practical aspects of successful attacks, such as stealthiness and user-experience. Considering the danger of WebGL abuse, as observed in the experiments, we designed and evaluated a proactive defense. We implemented a Chrome extension that proved itself effective in detecting and blocking WebGL. We demonstrate in our experiments the major improvements of WebGL 2.0 over WebGL 1.0 both in performance and in convenience. Furthermore, our results show that it is possible to use WebGL 2.0 in distributed attacks under real-world conditions.

Specifically, we leveraged a transformer-based topic modeling technique called BERTopic to identify wildfire response-related topics and then utilized the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model to compute two key metrics associated with wildfire responses - awareness and resilience indicators. Additionally, we used GIS-based spatial analysis to map wildfire locations along with four groups of city-level factors (racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, demographic, and wildfire-specific).

This is a critical step toward developing risk-informed strategies to mitigate grid-ignited wildfires from both operational and financial perspectives. This paper proposes and develops an integrated model to evaluate the damage costs associated with potential grid-ignited wildfires to allow assessing financial risk with greater precision than existing literature. The proposed model is tailored to assess the financial risk associated with grid-ignited wildfires, including environmental damages, destroyed structures, and damage to the power grid assets. We quantify the risk associated with each power line, thereby identifying areas that require immediate preemptive actions. To visually represent the risk levels associated with the transmission grid topology, we implement a color-coded risk heatmap.

The utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, has shown promise in aiding wildfire management efforts. This work focuses on the development of an optimal wildfire escape route planning system specifically designed for drones, considering dynamic fire and smoke models. First, the location of the source of the wildfire can be well located by information fusion between UAV and satellite, and the road conditions in the vicinity of the fire can be assessed and analyzed using multi-channel remote sensing data. Second, the road network can be extracted and segmented in real time using UAV vision technology, and each road in the road network map can be given priority based on the results of road condition classification. Third, the spread model of dynamic fires calculates the new location of the fire source based on the fire intensity, wind speed and direction, and the radius increases as the wildfire spreads. Smoke is generated around the fire source to create a visual representation of a burning fire. Finally, based on the improved A* algorithm, which considers all the above factors, the UAV can quickly plan an escape route based on the starting and destination locations that avoid the location of the fire source and the area where it is spreading.

Manipulating burn seasonality showed a feature importance of 6% or less regarding fire spread rate or fire intensity. While manipulated fire return interval and seasonality moderated both fire spread rate and intensity, their overall effects were low in comparison with meteorological (hydrological and climatic) variables. The variables with the highest feature importance regarding fire spread rate resulted in fuel moisture with 21%, relative humidity with 15%, wind speed with 14%, and last years rainfall with 14%. The variables with the highest feature importance regarding fire intensity included fuel load with 21.5%, fuel moisture with 16.5%, relative humidity with 12.5%, air temperature with 12.5%, and rainfall with 12.5%. Predicting fire spread rate and intensity has been a poor endeavour thus far and we show that more data of the variables already monitored would not result in higher predictive accuracy.", "date": "2020-05-15", "source": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07593v3", "query": "fire spread animation", "categories": ["q-bio.PE", "q-bio.QM", "stat.AP"], "keywords": ["fire spread"], "relevance_score": 0.25, "discovered_at": "2025-10-29T08:18:03.389776"}

In terms of data, we analyze key predictive features, including fuel characteristics, meteorological and climatic conditions, socioeconomic factors, topography, and hydrology, while also reviewing publicly available wildfire prediction datasets derived from remote sensing.

To address these challenges, we propose FSLens, an interactive visual analytics system that enables in-depth evaluation and rational optimization of fire station layout. Our approach integrates fire records and correlation features to reveal fire occurrence patterns and influencing factors using spatiotemporal sequence forecasting.

The formulation of this minimal model is motivated by the experimentally observed widespread variation of neural firing thresholds. We show numerically that the mean first passage time can depend non-monotonically on the noise amplitude. For sufficiently large values of the correlation time of the stochastic threshold the mean first passage time is maximal for non-vanishing noise. We provide an explanation for this effect by analytically transforming the original model into a first passage time problem for Brownian motion. This transformation also allows for a perturbative calculation of the first passage time histograms. In turn this provides quantitative insights into the mechanisms that lead to the non-monotonic behaviour of the mean first passage time. The perturbation expansion is in excellent agreement with direct numerical simulations. The approach developed here can be applied to any deterministic subthreshold dynamics and any Gauss-Markov processes for the firing threshold. This opens up the possibility to incorporate biophysically detailed components into the subthreshold dynamics, rendering our approach a powerful framework that sits between traditional integrate-and-fire models and complex mechanistic descriptions of neural dynamics.", "date": "2015-04-15", "source": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03983v2", "query": "fire simulation rendering", "categories": ["q-bio.NC", "math.PR", "physics.bio-ph"], "keywords": [], "relevance_score": 0.15, "discovered_at": "2025-10-29T08:18:03.389891"}

A major downside of existing approaches while rendering an image is that they require evaluating the network multiple times per camera ray so that the high computational time forms a bottleneck for downstream applications. We address this problem by introducing a novel neural scene representation that we call the directional distance function (DDF). To this end, we learn a signed distance function (SDF) along with our DDF model to represent a class of shapes. Specifically, our DDF is defined on the unit sphere and predicts the distance to the surface along any given direction. Therefore, our DDF allows rendering images with just a single network evaluation per camera ray. Based on our DDF, we present a novel fast algorithm (FIRe) to reconstruct 3D shapes given a posed depth map.

Second, it employs an aspect ratio-based random forest model to classify fire pattern shapes. Third, fire scene point cloud segmentation enables precise identification of fire-affected areas and the mapping of 2D fire patterns to 3D scenes. Lastly, spatial relationships between fire patterns and indoor elements support an interpretation of the fire scene. These components provide a method for fire pattern analysis that synthesizes qualitative and quantitative data. The framework's classification results achieve 93% precision on synthetic data and 83% on real fire patterns.", "date": "2024-10-30", "source": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23105v1", "query": "scientific visualization fire", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.HC"], "keywords": [], "relevance_score": 0.0, "discovered_at": "2025-10-29T08:18:03.390046"}

Distinguishing between fuzzy and non-fuzzy object detection in CV is important. Fuzzy objects such as fire, smoke, mist, and steam present significantly greater complexities in terms of visual features, blurred edges, varying shapes, opacity, and volume compared to non-fuzzy objects such as trees and cars. Collection of a balanced and diverse dataset and accurate annotation is crucial to achieve better ML models for fuzzy objects, however, the task of collection and annotation is still highly manual. In this research, we propose and leverage an alternative method of generating and automatically annotating fully synthetic fire images based on 3D models for training an object detection model. Moreover, the performance, and efficiency of the trained ML models on synthetic images is compared with ML models trained on real imagery and mixed imagery. Findings proved the effectiveness of the synthetic data for fire detection, while the performance improves as the test dataset covers a broader spectrum of real fires. Our findings illustrates that when synthetic imagery and real imagery is utilized in a mixed training set the resulting ML model outperforms models trained on real imagery as well as models trained on synthetic imagery for detection of a broad spectrum of fires. The proposed method for automating the annotation of synthetic fuzzy objects imagery carries substantial implications for reducing both time and cost in creating computer vision models specifically tailored for detecting fuzzy objects.", "date": "2024-10-01", "source": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01124v1", "query": "3D fire visualization", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "keywords": ["opacity"], "relevance_score": 0.0, "discovered_at": "2025-10-29T08:18:03.390063"}

Thus, forecasting the pollution caused by wildland fires has acquired high importance. WRF and SFIRE model wildland fire spread in a two-way interaction with the atmosphere. The surface heat flux from the fire causes strong updrafts, which in turn change the winds and affect the fire spread. Fire emissions, estimated from the burning organic matter, are inserted in every time step into WRF-Chem tracers at the lowest atmospheric layer. The buoyancy caused by the fire then naturally simulates plume dynamics, and the chemical transport in WRF-Chem provides a forecast of the pollution spread.

A recent simulation study showed that under increased fire regimes positive tree-tree interactions were recorded (Bacelar et al., 2014). Data from experimental burning plots in an African savanna, the Kruger National Park, were collected across unburnt and annual burn plots. Indices of aggregation and spatial autocorrelation of the distribution of trees between different fire regimes were explored. Results show that the distribution of trees under fire were more clumped and exhibited higher spatial autocorrelation than in unburnt plots: In burnt plots spatial autocorrelation values were positive at finer scales and negative at coarser scales potentially indicating co-existence of facilitation and competition within the same ecosystem depending on the scale. The pattern derived here provides inference for (a) fire acting as an increasing aggregation & spatial autocorrelation force (b) tree survival under fire regimes is potentially facilitated by forming patches of trees (c) scale-dependent facilitation and competition coexisting within the same ecosystem with finer scale facilitation and coarser scale competition.", "date": "2014-12-15", "source": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4701v1", "query": "interactive fire simulation", "categories": ["q-bio.PE"], "keywords": [], "relevance_score": 0.0, "discovered_at": "2025-10-29T08:18:03.390106"}

Conditions of long-lasting coexistence of trees and grasses have been mainly studied using continuous-time modelling of tree-grass competition. In these frameworks, fire is a time-continuous forcing while the relationship between woody plant size and fire-sensitivity is not systematically considered. In this paper, we propose a new mathematical framework to model tree-grass interaction that takes into account both the discrete nature of fire occurrence and size-dependent fire sensitivity (via two classes of woody plants). We carry out a qualitative analysis that highlights ecological thresholds and bifurcations parameters that shape the dynamics of the savanna-like systems within the main ecological zones. Moreover, through a qualitative analysis, we show that the impulsive modelling of fire occurrences leads to more diverse behaviors and a more realistic array of solutions than the analogous time-continuous fire models. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical results and to support a discussion about the bifurcation parameters and future developments.", "date": "2015-04-23", "source": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06224v1", "query": "interactive fire simulation", "categories": ["math.DS", "34A37, 92B05, 65L05"], "keywords": [], "relevance_score": 0.0, "discovered_at": "2025-10-29T08:18:03.390115"}

{"title": "Simple and robust speckle detection method for fire and heat detection   in harsh environments", "abstract": "Standard laser based fire detection systems are often based on measuring variation of optical signal amplitude. However, mechanical noise interference and loss from dust and steam can obscure the detection signal, resulting in faulty results or inability to detect a potential fire. The presented fire detection technology will allow the detection of fire in harsh and dusty areas, which are prone to fires, where current systems show limited performance or are unable to operate. It is not the amount of light nor its wavelength that is used for detecting fire, but how the refractive index randomly fluctuates due to the heat convection from the fire. In practical terms this means that light obstruction from ambient dust particles will not be a problem as long as a small fraction of the light is detected and that fires without visible flames can still be detected. The standalone laser system consists of a Linux-based Red Pitaya system, a cheap 650 nm laser diode, and a PIN photo-detector. Laser light propagates through the monitored area and reflects off a retroreflector generating a speckle pattern. Every 3 seconds time traces and frequency noise spectra are measured and 8 descriptors are deduced to identify a potential fire. Both laboratory and factory acceptance tests have been performed with success.", "date": "2019-08-12", "source": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12389v1", "query": "GPU particle system fire", "focus": "web_rendering", "keywords": [], "relevance_score": 0.0, "discovered_at": "2025-10-29T08:18:03.390172"}
{"title": "Fire detection in a still image using colour information", "abstract": "Colour analysis is a crucial step in image-based fire detection algorithms. Many of the proposed fire detection algorithms in a still image are prone to false alarms caused by objects with a colour similar to fire. To design a colour-based system with a better false alarm rate, a new colour-differentiating conversion matrix, efficient on images of high colour complexity, is proposed. The elements of this conversion matrix are obtained by performing K-medoids clustering and Particle Swarm Optimisation procedures on a fire sample image with a background of high fire-colour similarity. The proposed conversion matrix is then used to construct two new fire colour detection frameworks. The first detection method is a two-stage non-linear image transformation framework, while the second is a direct transformation of an image with the proposed conversion matrix. A performance comparison of the proposed methods with alternate methods in the literature was carried out. Experimental results indicate that the linear image transformation method outperforms other methods regarding false alarm rate while the non-linear two-stage image transformation method has the best performance on the F-score metric and provides a better trade-off between missed detection and false alarm rate.", "date": "2018-03-10", "source": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03828v1", "query": "GPU particle system fire", "focus": "web_rendering", "keywords": [], "relevance_score": 0.0, "discovered_at": "2025-10-29T08:18:03.390180"}
{"title": "Spiking Network Initialisation and Firing Rate Collapse", "abstract": "In recent years, newly developed methods to train spiking neural networks (SNNs) have rendered them as a plausible alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in terms of accuracy, while at the same time being much more energy efficient at inference and potentially at training time. However, it is still unclear what constitutes a good initialisation for an SNN. We often use initialisation schemes developed for ANN training which are often inadequate and require manual tuning. In this paper, we attempt to tackle this issue by using techniques from the ANN initialisation literature as well as computational neuroscience results. We show that the problem of weight initialisation for ANNs is a more nuanced problem than it is for ANNs due to the spike-and-reset non-linearity of SNNs and the firing rate collapse problem. We firstly identify and propose several solutions to the firing rate collapse problem under different sets of assumptions which successfully solve the issue by leveraging classical random walk and Wiener processes results. Secondly, we devise a general strategy for SNN initialisation which combines variance propagation techniques from ANNs and different methods to obtain the expected firing rate and membrane potential distribution based on diffusion and shot-noise approximations. Altogether, we obtain theoretical results to solve the SNN initialisation which consider the membrane potential distribution in the presence of a threshold. Yet, to what extent can these methods be successfully applied to SNNs on real datasets remains an open question.", "date": "2023-05-13", "source": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08879v1", "query": "shader-based fire rendering", "focus": "web_rendering", "keywords": [], "relevance_score": 0.0, "discovered_at": "2025-10-29T08:18:03.390187"}
