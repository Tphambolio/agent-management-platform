These characteristics, involving the\npresence of multiple fuel streams, a rapid phase change process, and strong\nheat loss, pose challenges for flamelet modeling of liquid ammonia combustion.\nTo address these issues, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of\nflamelet-based models for liquid ammonia combustion in a turbulent mixing\nlayer. Specifically, the extended flamelet/progress variable (E-FPV), extended\nflamelet-generated manifolds (E-FGM), and extended hybrid (E-Hybrid) models are\ndeveloped and assessed. Firstly, a three-dimensional Point-Particle Direct\nNumerical Simulation (PP-DNS) with detailed chemistry is performed, where the\nturbulent flow is fully resolved, and the ammonia droplets are described by the\nLagrangian method, to investigate the combustion characteristics of a liquid\nammonia/methane co-fired flame and to provide state-of-the-art validation data\nfor flamelet modeling.

Therefore, perturbation by climate change or human\nimpact may lead to crossing of a tipping point beyond which there is rapid\nforest dieback that is not easily reversed. A hypothesised mechanism for such\nbistability is a feedback between fire and vegetation, where fire spreads as a\ncontagion process on grass patches. Theoretical models have largely implemented\nthis mechanism implicitly, by assuming a threshold dependence of fire spread on\nflammable vegetation. Here, we show how the nonlinear dynamics and bistability\nemerge spontaneously, without assuming equations or thresholds for fire spread.\nWe find that the forest geometry causes the nonlinearity that induces\nbistability. We demonstrate this in three steps. First, we model forest and\nfire as interacting contagion processes on grass patches, %using a cellular\nautomaton showing that spatial structure emerges due to two counteracting\neffects on the forest perimeter: forest expansion by dispersal, and forest\nerosion by fires originating in adjacent grassland. Then, we derive a\nlandscape-scale balance equation in which these two effects link forest\ngeometry and dynamics: forest expands proportionally to its perimeter, while it\nshrinks proportionally to its perimeter weighted by adjacent grassland area.\nFinally, we show that these perimeter quantities introduce nonlinearity in our\nbalance equation and lead to bistability.

To generate new insights into this problem, we present a\nspatial Markov jump process model of savanna forest fires that integrates key\necological processes, including seed dispersal, fire spread, and non-linear\nvegetation flammability. In contrast to many models of forest-savanna\nbistability, we explicitly model both fire dynamics and vegetation regrowth in\na mathematically tractable framework. This approach bridges the gap between\nslow-timescale vegetation models and highly resolved fire dynamics, shedding\nlight on the influence of short-term and transient processes on vegetation\ncover. In our spatial stochastic model, bistability arises from periodic fires\nthat maintain low forest cover, whereas dense forest areas inhibit fire spread\nand preserve high tree density.

However, dense canopy structures, spectral overlaps\nbetween living and dead vegetation, and over-segmentation errors limit the\nreliability of existing methods. This study introduces a hybrid postprocessing\nframework that refines deep learning-based tree segmentation by integrating\nwatershed algorithms with adaptive filtering, enhancing boundary delineation,\nand reducing false positives in complex forest environments. Tested on\nhigh-resolution aerial imagery from boreal forests, the framework improved\ninstance-level segmentation accuracy by 41.5% and reduced positional errors by\n57%, demonstrating robust performance in densely vegetated regions. By\nbalancing detection accuracy and over-segmentation artifacts, the method\nenabled the precise identification of individual dead trees, which is critical\nfor ecological monitoring. The framework's computational efficiency supports\nscalable applications, such as wall-to-wall tree mortality mapping over large\ngeographic regions using aerial or satellite imagery. These capabilities\ndirectly benefit wildfire risk assessment (identifying fuel accumulations),\ncarbon stock estimation (tracking emissions from decaying biomass), and\nprecision forestry (targeting salvage loggings).

{"title": "Fuel characterization using remote sensing in support of large-scale wildfire management in the Cerrado biome", "summary": "<jats:p>Cerrado is the most biodiverse tropical savanna in the world characterized by a range of vegetation structures from grasslands to forests. However, Cerrado\u2019s stability has been threatened by anthropogenic changes in the fire regime. Managing fuels is one of the most important options we have for reducing wildfire\u2019s negative impacts on society and the environment and amplifying positive ones on fire-dependent flora. Large areas such as Cerrado often require remote sensors to characterize fuels, especially those on-board space-based platforms. Even though spaceborne sensors have been around for over 50 years, new opportunities arise with recently launched sensors with unprecedented characteristics. Yet, Cerrado fuel properties and their potential to be characterized with the new generation of sensors are still little studied. In this thesis proximal and near-surface approaches as a step forward to scale-up Cerrado fuel properties are presented. The thesis is divided into three chapters, where: i) fuel moisture content is predicted using leaf spectroscopy and machine learning algorithms, ii) fuel load is predicted for the whole Cerrado extent using lidar data collected from unoccupied aerial vehicles and the recently launched GEDI spaceborne lidar sensor and ili) a review of the novel spaceborne remote sensors with potential to be used for fuel characterization and the main fuel-related variables for integrated fire management is presented. The results showed the applicability of spectroscopy and lidar data together with machine learning to retrieve important fuel characteristics for fire management. With the increasing availability of data from sensors with new technologies and capabilities, which allow the upscaling of information collected in the field, it is suggested that we are facing a new era for the mapping and monitoring of fuels, which is essential for the development of integrated fire management programs aiming at preserving the Cerrado biome and similar ecosystems worldwide.

{"title": "Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Vegetation Condition (VCI) of the Tadarimana Indigenous Land to Identify Susceptible Areas to Forest Fire", "summary": "<jats:p>Forests fires can occur in a natural way in the dry season, aggravated by anthropic practices. Remote sensing and geoprocessing techniques demarcate and spatialize land surface data making possible the study and monitoring this areas. It's intended to subsidize managers of environmental and civil defense agencies, in terms of methodological routine, aiming to set preventive and reactive actions, in terms of combating fires in the Tadarimana Indigenous Land (TIT), in Rondon\u00f3polis, Mato Grosso, Brazil. August 27, 2017, a forest fire occurred in the TIT, which consumed 5,203,493 hectares of native vegetation, causing several damages to the local biodiversity. This episode was the motivating element of the research. Seven scenes from the Landsat-8 satellite were utilized, understanding the months from april to november 2017. To characterize the aspects of vegetation vigor and vulnerability to fire, was used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), considering the minimum and maximum values of NDVI. Rainfall and heat spot source data provided by the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) were also used in the analysis. Was generate NDVI maps with bands 4 (Red) and 5 (NIR), circling the official limits of TIT and its surroundings (1000 m buffer). For the months of april and november, the average rainfall was 0.807 and 0.817 mm respectively. In july and august the values decreased by 0.645 and 0.591mm. In september there was the lowest NDVI value (0.48), which can range from -1 to +1. Around TI, the month of april presented NDVI value of 0.716. Two hot spots dated august 27 were identified inside the TIT and not around it (1000 m buffer). From this results, it's possible to determine the beginning of a critical period to intensify the environmental monitoring at TIT before the occurrence of fires. For example, august 2017, with a minimum NDVI values of -0.749, most critical fires prevention actions could be implemented.</jats:p>", "date": "2020", "url": "https://doi.org/10.37002/biobrasil.v10i1.1546", "source": "crossref", "query": "forest fire vegetation rendering", "relevance": 0.1}

{"title": "A study of fire and plume dynamics for static pool fires and their interaction with vegetation", "summary": "<jats:p>Prescribed burns are an essential tool of fire management to reduce the impact and occurrence of wildfires. While managing prescribed burns, the smoke trajectory and downwind exposure to smoke are intimately coupled with the smoke production dynamics and the development of the fire plume in the vicinity of the fire front. In turn, the fire plume development is strongly coupled to fire behavior and the flow environment near the fire. This work aims at understanding fire behavior and plume development while interacting with vegetation at the large laboratory scale through experiments and modeling. In order to investigate these coupled processes, initially, flame and plume behavior from a static fire source will be characterized. A rectangular pool fire fueled by diesel is used and point measurements of flow, temperature and heat flux will be conducted. The burning rate will be measured using a load cell. K-type thermocouples and bi-directional pressure probes will be used for measuring the temperature and velocity, respectively in the flame and plume zones. These data will be used for validating a numerical model for simulating pool fires and the model will be subsequently used for predicting the plume interaction with vegetation. A Douglas fir tree, whose properties are well defined in the literature, will be used as vegetation. The Lagrangian particle model available in the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) will be used to model the tree. The tree will be of regular shape and size with foliage and different classes of wood segregated based on typical size (diameter) range. The bulk density of the tree will be varied to replicate the systematic and controlled variation of the flow obstruction encountered by the plume and gives a realistic prediction of velocity, temperature, and heat flux within the vegetation. In the future, experiments with vegetation located in the plume region will be conducted to validate the numerical predictions.</jats:p>", "date": "2022", "url": "https://doi.org/10.14195/978-989-26-2298-9_238", "source": "crossref", "query": "fire vegetation interaction graphics", "relevance": 0.1}

{"title": "Holocene fire regimes around the Altai-Sayan Mountains and adjacent plains: interaction with climate and vegetation types", "summary": "<jats:p>Abstract. The Altai-Sayan Mountains and adjacent plains have experienced accelerated warming in recent decades, heightening concerns about escalating fire risks. However, critical knowledge gaps persist regarding paleofire dynamics in western Mongolia and comprehensive regional syntheses of biomass burning patterns across the Altai-Sayan ecoregion. Addressing these gaps is essential for understanding vegetation resilience under projected environmental changes and disturbance regimes. This study reconstructs the Holocene fire sequence in the steppe region of western Mongolia and systematically elucidates the spatiotemporal variations in biomass burning across different vegetation zones of the Altai-Sayan Mountains and adjacent plains, as well as their coupling relationships with forest community structure. The results demonstrate that the declining biomass burning since the Holocene has been primarily controlled by temperature-mediated variations in woody biomass above the forest limit in the central Altai Mountains, while in the western Sayan and northern Altai Mountains, it stems from significant reductions in combustible components (Larix, Abies and Picea). Notably, a marked resurgence of biomass burning has been observed since ~4 cal. kyr BP in multiple regions associated with archaeological cultural complexes. This intensification of fire activity during the late Holocene predominantly occurred in two types of previously low-fire-risk areas: 1) regions where excessive moisture and cold climate inhibited sufficient fuel accumulation (e.g., the West Siberian Plain and mountain taiga zones of the Altai Mountains), and 2) arid environments where steppe/desert-steppe vegetation failed to maintain continuous combustible substrates. Since ~2 cal kyr BP, intensified anthropogenic disturbances including agricultural expansion and pastoral activities have significantly increased surface fire frequency in the southeastern/western and northern Altai Mountains, West Siberian Plain, and forest zones of the central Altai Mountains. In contrast, the dramatic decline in biomass burning observed in the Khangai Mountains may be closely linked to vegetation fragmentation induced by overgrazing. This research clarifies the long-term feedback mechanisms between biomass burning processes and forest community structure across different vegetation zones. The findings hold significant scientific value for understanding human-fire-ecosystem interactions in the arid Central Asia, while offering historical references for regional sustainable ecological management.\n                        </jats:p>", "date": "2025", "url": "https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2025-1991", "source": "crossref", "query": "fire vegetation interaction graphics", "relevance": 0.2}

Fires may either consume the entire acacia shoot and ant colony, scorch and kill the acacia but not the ants, or kill neither acacia nor ant colony. Which alternative occurs depends on the structure of the immediately surrounding vegetation which in turn depends on how much of it has been killed by the ant colony and how fast the acacia has grown. The survival of the acacia population in frequently burned areas is almost entirely dependent upon some ant colonies surviving the fire to occupy the new sucker shoots from acacia stumps. The effect of these fires on the evolution of the interaction between the ant and the acacia is discussed.</jats:p>", "date": "1967", "url": "https://doi.org/10.2307/1933414", "source": "crossref", "query": "fire vegetation interaction graphics", "relevance": 0.05}

{"title": "What Can we Learn from Long-Term Fire Experiments? Fire  Behavior, Fire Effects on Vegetation and Flammability of the  Cerrado", "summary": "<jats:p>Fire is an important ecological and evolutionary factor influencing the Cerrado vegetation for millions of years. However, the use of fire as a management tool is still very controversial in nature reserves in Brazil. Thus, long-term fire experiments can bring important information about fire behavior and effects on vegetation, helping local managers to make decisions about fire management in nature reserves. We aim to sum up the results of a 7-year ongoing fire (2013-present) experiment established in Central Brazil in campo sujo (open savannas). We had treatments related to fire frequency (annual/biennial fires) and season (early , mid-, late-dry). We measured fire parameters (flame height, fire temperatures, fire intensity). Moreover, we evaluated flammability traits from the main group of species in the area. Finally, we evaluated changes in the plant community in response to the treatments. In general, fires are fast, of low intensity, temperatures and residence time of fire. The drier the vegetation, the more intense the fire is, due to the high amount of dead biomass and water content of the fuel load. This fuel load is mostly composed by highly flammable grasses, that become more flammable at the end of the dry season. Forbs and shrubs are not flammable and thus, the main component of the fuel load is the graminoid layer. Annual fires led to a decrease in graminoids cover, which in turn, influenced fire propagation and intensity, leading to less intense and irregular fires. On the other hand, burning plots biennially did not affect negatively any of the plant community components and, after two years, there was already enough fuel load for the next fire. The major effect of fire season was on plant phenology, since time of fire changed time of flowering in our plots. However, the main result is that fire enhanced flowering in all treatments, being important for pollination, seed production and dispersal. The use of fire experiments as a tool should be implemented to help local managers to take decisions about fire management in Cerrado nature reserves and they could be designed according to the needs of the local managers.</jats:p>", "date": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.37002/biodiversidadebrasileira.v9i1.1297", "source": "crossref", "query": "fire vegetation interaction graphics", "relevance": 0.15000000000000002}
