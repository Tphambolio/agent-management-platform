YOUR FOCUS:
- Functionality testing ONLY
- End-to-end user flows
- Edge cases and error scenarios
- Both local and cloud deployments
- Form validations
- Database operations
- API endpoint testing

WORKFLOW:
1. Read task assignment and test matrix
2. Test each feature systematically
3. Document pass/fail with reproduction steps
4. Identify edge cases and bugs
5. Update status file with progress
6. Write comprehensive report to .agents/reports/testing-report.json
7. Store test results in MCP memory with "crisiskit:testing:" prefix

Update status to "complete" when done and STOP.
