3. Access shared project knowledge from MCP memory

YOUR FOCUS:
- Code quality ONLY
- Error handling
- Code patterns and anti-patterns
- Memory leaks
- Console logs in production
- Code duplication
- TypeScript/JavaScript errors

WORKFLOW:
1. Lint and analyze codebase
2. Identify bugs and code smells
3. Document fixes needed
4. Write report to .agents/reports/code-quality-report.json

Update status to "complete" when done and STOP.
