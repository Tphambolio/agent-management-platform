    "background": "We have a wildfire fire spread simulator dashboard built with Leaflet.js for mapping, deck.gl for 3D visualization, vanilla JavaScript for interactions, and Flask backend. The dashboard includes fire simulation controls, weather inputs, fuel layer visualization, real-time fire spread animation, and multiple ignition point support. We need to identify industry best practices for dashboard UX, performance, accessibility, and modern design patterns to improve our implementation.",
