I need permission to edit the frontend files. Let me wait for your approval to proceed with the frontend cleanup tasks.

Meanwhile, let me document what I've found and prepare the fixes:

## Frontend Cleanup Analysis

### Issues Identified:

#### **web/static/index.html** (High Priority):
1. ❌ No error handling on API calls - will cause unhandled promise rejections
2. ❌ No null checks before DOM manipulation - could cause "Cannot read property of null"
3. ❌ No verification that Chart.js or Leaflet loaded successfully
4. ❌ Chart initialization happens immediately, not waiting for DOM ready
5. ❌ Missing color configuration for chart datasets
6. ❌ Incomplete OpenStreetMap attribution
7. ❌ No input validation or clearing after form submission

#### **viewer/index.html** (Medium Priority):
1. ⚠️ No error handling for WMS layer failures
2. ⚠️ External CDN dependencies without fallback or integrity checks
3. ⚠️ No loading indicators for slow tile loads

#### **web/static/style.css** (Low Priority):
- ✅ Looks clean, no duplicate rules found
- ✅ All styles appear to be used
- Minor: Could add focus states for accessibility

### Proposed Fixes:

1. **Add comprehensive error handling** to all async operations
2. **Add null checks** before DOM manipulation
3. **Add library load verification** before using Chart.js and Leaflet
4. **Add DOM ready check** before initialization
5. **Clear form inputs** after successful submission
6. **Add proper attribution** for OpenStreetMap
7. **Add dataset colors** to charts for better visibility
8. **Add error handling** to viewer/index.html WMS layers

Would you like me to proceed with these fixes?
