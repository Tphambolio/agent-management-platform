Score: 65/100
Assessment: ⚠️ NEEDS ATTENTION - Multiple issues detected

ISSUES DETECTED:
  ⚠️ Almost no fire spread detected (0.09% of area)
  ⚠️ Fire pattern is fragmented (101 disconnected patches)

SUGGESTIONS:
  💡 Check ignition points and fuel conditions
  💡 Fire spread should be spatially continuous - check model physics

Score: 50/100
Assessment: ⚠️ QUESTIONABLE - Significant deviations from physical reality

VALIDATIONS PASSED:
  ✓ FFMC 92.0 consistent with extreme fire conditions
  ✓ All fire values are non-negative
  ✓ Values are within valid probability range (max: 1.000)

ISSUES DETECTED:
  ⚠️ Wind speed 60.0 km/h deviates 50% from Jasper 2024 observed 40 km/h
  ❌ FBP calculation failed: get_fire_behavior() got an unexpected keyword argument 'aspect'

WARNINGS:
  ⚠️ Predicted 8291 ha vs Jasper actual 5000 ha (66% error)

REFERENCE: Jasper 2024 Fire
  Actual: 5000 ha after 24h
  Conditions: FFMC=94, Wind=40 km/h

Score: 60/100
Assessment: ⚠️ QUESTIONABLE - Significant deviations from physical reality

VALIDATIONS PASSED:
  ✓ FFMC 92.0 consistent with extreme fire conditions
  ✓ Fire intensity 0 kW/m is physically plausible
  ✓ Crown fire conditions correctly identified
  ✓ All fire values are non-negative
  ✓ Values are within valid probability range (max: 1.000)

ISSUES DETECTED:
  ⚠️ Wind speed 60.0 km/h deviates 50% from Jasper 2024 observed 40 km/h
  ⚠️ ROS 0.0 m/min is outside expected range for C2 under these conditions

WARNINGS:
